You’re doing well.

Change is always scary. It’s even scarier when the outcomes of that change are not what you expected. As children, we’re always told not to rush, and that we have our whole lives ahead of us, but as soon as we enter adulthood we’re saturated with a sense of urgency - that time’s running out - and are told that all of our milestones have a pre-determined deadline - _get out there and do it, but beware of failure!_

I think we as humans have such a fixation on moving forward as fast as possible, as if it’s a race to the finish line, that we don’t give ourselves the time to prepare for undesirable results, or to learn how to deal with them. We’re told that failure is a point of no return. I find myself caught in this mentality now.

Now, I do have my own goals and timeframes in which I’d like to achieve these goals. That’s healthy. But I realise that I’ve been fortunate enough not to have made any decisions that have directly impacted my life or my wellbeing negatively - until recently.

Today, I find myself stuck between a rock and a hard place. I took the first opportunity that came my way, blind to the notion that there are other options out there, and now my mental and physical health is suffering because of it. Now that I’m here, I’m struggling to decide what’s the best way to remove myself from this situation - act now _(high risk but immediate removal from the core problem)_, or later _(lower risk, but longer exposure to the core problem)_?

Analysis paralysis.

Fortunately, I have a fantastic support unit who lend me their ears and their wise words. They can’t fix my problems for me, but they can offer me some clarity. Discussing my worries openly with those I otherwise wouldn’t have opened up to has exposed me to different points of view and provided me with a valuable learning opportunity.

Here’s where I am now:

I know that whatever I choose, I will never know if it was the ‘best’ decision, but it will always be better than doing nothing.

Although I’ve hit a bump in the road, I’m still travelling in the right direction.

TL;DR

- Things not going to plan ≠ failure
- Making no decision is worse than making a bad decision
- There’s always a Plan C

_I took the plunge._

_Despite now staring into the unknown, a huge weight has been lifted._

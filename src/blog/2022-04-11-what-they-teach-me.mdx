_“In loco parentis”_ - the legal doctrine under which an individual assumes parental rights, duties, and obligations without going through the formalities of legal adoption.

I’ve never wanted children of my own, so you can imagine the shock on my mother’s face when I announced I’d be entering the world of teaching. But taking on the role of “Miss” - the name I now proudly put on with my shoes as I leave for work each morning - has found me being a ‘part-time parent’ to a couple hundred children over the past two years and I’m amazed by the amount I’ve learnt from them about people, personalities, individualism... humanity as a whole.

Every child is different - this we know - but as a teacher, you see a side to these children that sometimes even their parents will never see.

Having been involved with a few different schools now, I’m astounded at just how much the school itself shapes the student and the adult they will become. Even in London alone, moving from one end of a borough to the other, I notice a drastic shift in how kids interact with one another, what they value and (problematic to _us_ when moving schools) what they look for in a teacher.

Being a teacher has moved so far away from just relaying subject knowledge. We have a duty to protect; to know the students, understand each circumstance and provide support of any and all kinds in the place of a parent or guardian. Developing the trust and healthy boundaries to do this is difficult, and it takes time, so although experiencing different schools teaches you a lot, moving around often really distances you from your students.

Tailoring my own teaching, mannerisms and language to each school, and each student within it, has taught me not only about the challenges parents face when raising children, or how we are shaped by the environment in which we grow up, but about how these kids think, what makes them who they are, and who they might grow to become.

A previous school of mine required more formal dress for staff and students, and my past students of this small religious school were eager to know where I was from and what I do in my spare time;

_“Miss, you look like you live in a mansion! Do you live in a mansion?”_

Contrasting my appearance, they were fascinated to hear about my love of gaming and kayaking. Those who resonated with me later became more enthusiastic in my lessons and more vocal and open in form-time conversations. A little like a good relationship with your parents. The small, close-knit school community meant everyone got to know each other, lessons could be more easily tailored to students’ backgrounds or interests, and everyone - even the adults - had an identity.

Moving to a bigger school, however, you suddenly interact with a broader spectrum of people; different needs and wants, students who are happy to see you and those who wouldn’t dare set foot through the door if they were given the choice. I noticed these students are more candid, have more ‘quirks’, but have less time to get to know their teachers. This makes it harder to get to know everyone equally, and even harder to pinpoint when and how to provide support in the lives of those that might need a little extra attention.

In these schools, we are ‘_teachers_’- the kind who don’t exist outside the school gates and, if spotted in the wild, are met with a face so astonished, mouth agape, that you have to pat yourself down to check you didn’t leave the house naked. At these Big Schools, students more often measure a teacher’s value based purely on what they see stood in front of them; _“organised”, “quick at handing out papers”, “amazing glasses”_ - just some of the points I found jotted in the back of a journal when comparing me to their old teacher on my first day. When you do get to the point where you know them and know what changes to look out for, however, the students know it. _They feel it_. And the personality and character that fills your classroom is like nothing I’ve ever seen.

_“And the best teacher is... Both but Miss Lewis >:)”_

Thanks, kid.

You meet young people with so many different stories as a teacher and you learn from every one of them. Happy and expressive children, shy and reserved, those who haven’t yet found where they belong, those with great relationships with the adults in their lives, those without. At school, I’m not just a science teacher. I listen and learn and support and advise. These kids and their families put their trust in us to help guide them on the right path during the most pivotal years of their lives. Acting _in loco parentis_ is incredibly intimidating, but it’s forever changed me and how I view the world.

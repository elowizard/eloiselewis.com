As we approach 2022 in good old 2021 fashion, I’m sat at home in my pyjamas feeling like nothing much has changed over the past 12 months.

In the grand scheme of things, sure, COVID remains life’s focal point, and we’re all playing a massive game of Red Light, Green Light, but my boyfriend has reminded me to take a step back and reflect on the smaller things - my own micro-changes.

In 2020, I moved from Wales to London to begin my teaching career. “How could I top that?!” I’d wonder. _Well... astronaut Chris Hadfield liked my Tweet... Does that count?_ I jotted down, completely missing the point. But there’s nothing to top - small events lead to these larger life events, so now looking back at this year, I realise I’ve paved a great path for my future.

My routines have suffered tremendously since early 2020, resulting in putting additional stress on my work and my own goals.

I’ve had a lot of habitual re-learning to do.

All in all, it’s been a success. I now have a healthy sleep schedule, I cook and eat well, and I build my work schedules _around_ my personal time. This has helped get me to a much better place than I was 12 months ago, with the help of making small changes and meeting some wonderful new people along the way.

It’s been a long year. In early January 2021, I was finalising the revisions of our research paper based on my Master’s thesis. By early February, it was published for the world to see. _My micro-contribution to science._

Ending working from home in March, another Lockdown Birthday in April, and a series of book-worthy altercations between my Nightmare Neighbours through to their eviction in June. By July I had left the school I moved to London for, ready to embark on my next journey.

The biggest shift in direction for me was when I moved in with my boyfriend in September. Spending so many hours of every day with each other, our habits started to evolve and merge, our routines were established, and we witnessed each other’s mini-moments of stress and success each day. The next few months were a blur, yet it feels like a lifetime. I’ve made many fond memories that I mustn’t forget to also attribute my current position to.

Unfortunately I contracted COVID just in time to ruin all of our family Christmas plans, and so I spent a second Christmas in London. This time, however, I embraced the opportunity to celebrate the holiday differently, to cook my first Christmas dinner from scratch (luckily I regained my taste and smell that morning!), and enjoy the quieter time with my loved one, between all the coughs and sneezes.

So many small things have happened this year. They’ve made me a better teacher, a more attentive daughter, and a happier individual.

Here’s to another New Year celebration in our pyjamas, and another year of subtle progress.

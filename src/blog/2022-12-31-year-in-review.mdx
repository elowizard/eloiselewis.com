2021 was a year of enormous change _(Read last year's review <a class="link-text" href="https://www.eloiselewis.com/blog/2021-12-31-year-in-review">here</a>)_; this time last year, I was COVID-ridden, teaching myself how to build a website, new to blogs and recovering from the beautiful chaos of life. Reading back, I’ve struggled to put 2022 into words worthy of comparison to 2021.

I welcomed 2022 with a toast towards a year of subtle progress, and it has been just that; life catching up with the delays brought by COVID, a steady home, strong relationships, and just more time to breathe and focus on what makes me happy. And with that, I know there’s no need to write to ‘live up to 2021’, this year has been more personal, and this blog was created for myself to document my own experiences. So here’s my 2022 rundown…

2022 has been a year of celebration; starting in February with my boyfriend’s 30th birthday and eating delicious cake for a week straight, lots (and lots) of new food and incredible sights through the spring, a trip to Brighton and the best birthday cake I’ve EVER had in April, the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations and a Dađi Freyr concert in June, and my delayed 2020 MChem graduation in July.

August took me to Croatia, where I could slow down and allow myself to just exist, in awe of the beauty and food each town had to offer. It was so refreshing to finally be able to explore somewhere new again, made even more special with a family dynamic I’ve never experienced until now and the new personal significance of Croatia to me.

Landing home, we ended the Summer with more wonderful chaos. I briefly met Tom Felton after his performance in 2:22, a quiet anniversary celebration, The Book of Mormon, hop on a flight back to Croatia for a wedding, back to London to start a new job the next day, a wedding in Wales, and my 2022 PGCE graduation by October. Phew!

And of course I had my _Big Annual Life Lesson_, too. The new job I had been so eager to start for months ended up being everything I never wanted. Endless chaos, stress, loss of all my free time and safety concerns. For me, I needed to learn pretty quickly that I have to brave change (as if 2021 wasn’t enough of that) and not worry about the _what-ifs_ or how it _might_ cause others to perceive me.

Seven weeks in, I resigned.

Shortly followed were three last-minute interviews, three incredible offers, a rocky final term at work, and a wonderful induction day ready for my new role. Cue more celebration.

November brought a second round of COVID, near 11 months to the day, and two snow days. Now in December, I was able to spend my first Christmas back home in 3 years! A quiet time with my small family was much needed.

So, although this year has been less poetic, less blog-worthy, it’s certainly been one to remember. A period of personal occasions and real-life experiences. I’ll be spending this New Year weekend watching the distant fireworks over the London Eye, journalling our big plans for the new year, taking comfort in the notion that life is going in the right direction and everything will be alright.
